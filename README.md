# INTRODUCTION
___
To successfully pass a job interview, it is essential to prepare for it in advance. As job seekers, we have found ourselves in need of some guidance and training, but what we found was insufficient.

Instead we have found that there’s not enough platforms to get prepared for a job interview, that there’s a lack of adequate resources and professional advice.

This is how we came up with JobWin. A social networking website that allows job seekers to interact with each other. Not only that, it’s also a platform in which the user can obtain a professional training as well as uncovering his hidden potentials.

# Team
___
- **Salmen Zouari : Frontend developer :** Salmen has some experience in design so the frontend part of the project has been his job . He also worked on the backend as he intend to study machine learning in the future.

- **Yasminz Hamdi : Backend developer :** Yasmine worked on the backend part considering she has a good background in it and has worked on similar projects before. It’ll allow her to improve her skills and use what she has learned until now.

- **Inès Chokri : Backend developer :** Inès is good with frameworks like flask and Django since she did previous projects working on them, therefore she worked on the backend side of the project.

# Technologies

# Backend technologies

**Python :** Among all the existing backend languages such as JAVA or PhP we decided to code with Python since it is a user-friendly and high-level programming language. We also have been working with it for some months now and find it really good.

**Flask :** We choose Flask instead of Django because it is a lightweight framework and allow us to work with the functionalities we want. We’ve been working with Flask lately and we find it really flexible and easy to use.

**Mysql :** As for the database of our website we have opted for mysql because it is compatible with all major hosting providers and is easy to manage. It is also the one which we are most comfortable working with.


# Frontend technologies

**Bootstrap :** Bootstrap framework is easy to use and allow us to have a responsive design thanks to its grid system. Another reason for choosing it is that it is compatible with all modern browsers.

**Javascript :**  JavaScript is used for creation of all types of interactive elements of websites. Javascript’s advantages is its full compatibility with most existing browsers. It’s one of the most used scripting languages and has a simple syntax and is easy to use for any purpose.
